Icons created in Photoshop

I created a circle, filled it in, then modified the selection to
shrink it and then repeated flood fill. The result is a basic circular
flat icon, it's better than the default Android head, and might also
last long enough that I can use it online.

Roman's site is great for cropping and getting xxhdpi xhdpi etc
variants: https://romannurik.github.io

Icons are copyright Vikram Aggarwal, since I created them
